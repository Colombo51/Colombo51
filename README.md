I am an all-out mainframe developer (COBOL/CICS/DB2/VSAM/REXX) and have been doing it for 3 decades. 
Now I want to convert COBOL to convert COBOL to native Java.  So I need to read as much as there is to understand the complexities, 
challanges and if I can do it. I can handle any dev project on the mainframe and know Java a little bit to be dangerous.
Best regards.
